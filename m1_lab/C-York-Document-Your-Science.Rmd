## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Formatting Text

*Italic*
**Bold**
This is `code` in text
# Header 1
## Header 2
* Unordered list item
1. Ordered list item
[Link](https://www.google.com)
$A = \pi \times r^{2}$

Practice:

This *sentence* contains **many** formats like
1. Like `code <- "inside text" `
* or [random links](https://www.google.com)
2. $C  = (A + B)/200 $
